DONE

	Dig in and work out where to start with the article

	Fix up the map so it's smooth and doesn't have any color pops.

	Add smoothing for the circle radius

	Tune the colors and radius motion

	Optimize the simulator so I can have more players running, or the same number of players running, but time moves faster.

	Do less work, and do it in ||

	Adding new players to the simulation can be done in || with the rest, eg. run it as a goroutine, in outputs a set of new active players, 

	Work 10 seconds at a time, instead of one second.

	I should be able to get an order of magnitude speed up, if I don't walk the players who are in game or waiting.

	To do this, I should be able to spin off goroutines that wait n seconds, and then report back with an event in a channel when they are finished.

	Add the event for "end match" -- it could include a list of active players.

	Add the channel for "end match"

	Spin up a goroutine to sleep for match length when players join a match

TODO

	...

	--------------------------

	Instead of walking all active players once per-second, and checking their states, active players can run in goroutines, and have sleeps or tickers so they wake up only when they need to do work?

	--------------------------

	And then there could be a tick per-datacenter, where the datacenter could attempt to grab players 
	
	--------------------------

	Make the map auto-adjust to maximum player count per-cell so it doesn't need manual configuration.

	--------------------------

	Add expanding focus circles when player counts in a cell pop up, to some maximum amount at a time.
