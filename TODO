DONE

	Profile again, see if there is still any low hanging fruit...

	Looks like it's reducing allocations, and fixing the datacenter lookup and sort.

TODO

	First thing I can do is create a constant time lookup from lat/long to the set of datacenters sorted in latency order.

	Then just point to this instead of calculating it each time a new player comes in

	-------------

	Then I need to look at allocations I'm doing, to see if I can remove them

	-------------

	Update index.html so the map can be dynamically sized according to the page?

	-------------

	Start writing the article?

	-------------

	Write terraform scripts to deploy the matchmaker to google cloud.

	-------------

	Integrate the map somehow with networknext.com main page?
