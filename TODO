TODO

	-------

	Update matchmaker.go to read in the datacenter definitions from the datacenters.csv

	Implement an example script that loads in datacenter binfile, eg. sanjose, and then prints out the latency from all datacenter lat/longs to sanjose.

	This is a good test to make sure the lat/long lookups are correct.

	-------

	Extend transform script to iterate across all datacenters and perform the transformation for each binfile to an output file.
