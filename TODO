DONE

	Update matchmaker.go to read in the datacenter definitions from the datacenters.csv

	Extend transform script to iterate across all datacenters and perform the transformation for each binfile to an output file.

TODO

	-------

	Implement an example script that loads in datacenter binfile, eg. sanjose, and then prints out the latency from all datacenter lat/longs to sanjose.

	This is a good test to make sure the lat/long lookups from the binfiles are correct...

	Done for now
