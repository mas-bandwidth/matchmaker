DONE

	Implement the widening in the warm body state

	Dummy out latency maps per-city to all zeros

	Load the data in for latency maps per-datecenter by name

TODO

	Implement code to load the latency map and transform into array of float32 values.

	Implement code to transform the latency map so that it "widens" via a filter, eg. take average of neighbours, for any lat/long square that is 0.0 and has any non-0.0 neighbours, on load.

	Implement code to look up the latency given a datacenter and player lat/long, first looking into the latency map, and then if the latency map entry is 0.0 using a conservative estimate according to speed of light * 3 at distance.

	Implement some sort of visualization (eg. output to portal cruncher?)
