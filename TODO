DONE

	Dig in and work out where to start with the article

	Fix up the map so it's smooth and doesn't have any color pops.

	Add smoothing for the circle radius

TODO

	Optimize the simulator so I can have more players running, or the same number of players running, but time moves faster.
	
	Make the map auto-adjust to maximum player count per-cell so it doesn't need manual configuration.

	Add expanding focus circles when player counts in a cell pop up, to some maximum amount at a time.
