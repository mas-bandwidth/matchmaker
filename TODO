DONE

	Implement the widening in the warm body state

	Dummy out latency maps per-city to all zeros

	Load the data in for latency maps per-datecenter by name

	Implement code to load the latency map and transform into array of float32 values.

	Finalize set of cities for simulator

	Implement code to get latency map value at lat/long, with clamping for latitude in range [-90,+90] during lookup, and wraparound for longitude such that values -1 turns into 360-1, and values 361 turns into 1, etc.

	Implement code to look up the latency given a datacenter and player lat/long, first looking into the latency map, and then if the latency map entry is 0.0 using a conservative estimate according to speed of light * 3 at distance.

	Split apart into "Expand" and "WarmBody" states.

	Fixed a bug in expansion calculation as function of t.

	Transform the latency map so that it "widens" via a filter, eg. take average of neighbours, for any lat/long square that is 0.0 and has any non-0.0 neighbours, on load.

	Move datacenter definitions into datacenters.csv

TODO

	Load the datacenter definitions and print out datacenter names with a new command './dist/datacenters'

	-------

	Implement an example script to load each datacenter raw file and read the datacenter definitions

	Then combine all datacenter maps into a combined.bin file, showing the lowest latency to any datacenter for each point on the map.

	-------

	Implement a processing script to transform each of the raw files into a 

	-------

	Work out a process for transforming raw input bin files into the filtered bin files.

	This process needs the lat/long for each datacenter to work...

	Stick datacenters into a csv file?
