DONE

	Define set of locations

	Bring haversine function across

	Implement latency to datacenter function (approximate for now...)

	Advertise as available to datacenters < 50ms latency for the first n seconds.	

	Add active players to to queues per-datacenter when they go into "ideal" state.

	Walk set of datacenters (random order) and iterate across all players in that queue, and send them off into games.

	Lower probability of new players.

	Parse the csv for real player data.

	Implement some strategy so I can sample a certain percentage chance of grabbing samples 1 in n chance.

	Implement logic to go into playing state

	Implement logic to go into bot matches

	Track the number of seconds players wait in matchmaking and print it out for each player when the match starts.

	Stick the player id inside the active player (for debugging)

	Feed warm body players back into matchmaking queues (basic, any datacenter that needs player...)

	Track number of players per-datacenter

TODO

	Track average latency per-datacenter

	--------

	Integrate per-datacenter latency map

	Implement regions
